#Welcome page for Open Zagreb

Note that branch `gh-pages` is what shows on production codeforvirginiabeach.org. Master does nothing.

##How to Code for this Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.
Option B: If in the Open Zagreb Brigade and you have write access to repo: Develop/test in your own branch, preferablly a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into gh-pages.

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, that you [let the team know on our message board](tbd).
