#Welcome page for Open Zagreb

Note that branch `master` is what shows on development openzagreb.github.io.

##How to Code for this Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.
Option B: If in the Open Zagreb Brigade and you have write access to repo: Develop/test in your own branch, preferablly a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into master.

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to master, that you [let the team know on our updates board](http://codeforcroatia.org/projects/pocetna_stranica_open_zagreb).
